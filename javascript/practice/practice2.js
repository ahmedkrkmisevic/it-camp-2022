const person = {

};

//   In the example above, this refers to the person object.

// I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of this.

// I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of person.
// In an object method, this refers to the object.
// Alone, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
// In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
// Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

in React.jsm a component is a place of code that represents a part of user interface.
It can be a class component or a functional component.
class component is a js class that extends reactt.Component class,while a functional component is a js.
function that returns only the React element.

A pureComponent is a special  type of component that is similiaar to a component,
but with adiotinal features 
or optimization.When a component is a pureComponent,
React will do a shallow comparasion of the props and 
state before re-endering the component .that means that if props and state 
have not changed the componend will not be re-endering.this can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but if it's not used properly
it can lead to unexpected behaviour

bottomline a component is the most basic and mosr=t used for building 
a block in react and pureComponent
is used when it needs some special optimization.
